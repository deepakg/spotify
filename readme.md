# Spotify Album Art Collage

![Album art collage](spotify-montage-QRht.png)
spotify-collage.pl takes a url to a Spotify playlist and stitches a collage of album art images of the tracks in that playlist.

- The album art images are resized to 200x200 pixels
- The images are laid out in a 4:3 grid
- The generated collage is saved in .png format in the folder that you run this script in.

### Usage

Before you can use the script, youâ€™ll need to set up an [application on Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications). This will give you a client\_id and client\_secret. You'll need to save these to a file called .api_keys in your home directory:

```
[spotify]
client_id = <your client_id>
client_secret = <your client_secret>
```

This script also has following dependencies that you'd need to install from CPAN:

- Config::INI::Reader
- Imager::Montage
- JSON::XS

You should then be able to run the script as:

```
perl spotify-collage.pl --playlist https://open.spotify.com/user/beatlesplaylists/playlist/1FbXE0DKfcNlIRexSEHcs8
```

```

If you run it without the --playlist option, it'll use this hardcoded playlist with 8 songs: https://open.spotify.com/user/deepak.gulati/playlist/7EhvGQRwc71oEpRjvEV6uR

### Dependencies

I've only tested this script on macOS 10.12.3. If you have a working installation of Perl 5.14 or higher and are able to install the dependencies, it *should* work on older versions of macOS as well. It might work on Linux with little or no tweaking but about Windows I am considerably less sure.
